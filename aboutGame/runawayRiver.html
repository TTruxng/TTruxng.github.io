          <h3>Experience</h3>
          <p>This was one of my games that I helped design for a course's final project. As a team, we managed to divide work amongst everyone under a designated role.</p>
          <p>My role as the  lead artist meant that I was to provide assets for the game, which meant being able to model, rig, and animate objects, plan and create UI layouts, and overseeing the overall artistic side of the game,  all in due time.</p>
          <p>As this game was the first time I learned how to 3D model, rig, and animate, I learned a lot along the way by adopting to the programs I was required to use for the project.</p>
          <hr>
            <p>Responsibilities:
            <ul class="mx-5">
              <li>Collaborate effectively and efficiently with team members by establishing roles and ensuring all tasks are fulfilled in a timely and well-ordered workflow</li>
              <li>Design UI assets that allow players to navigate and add input into the game, ensuring that UI is clear and concise for players to comprehend the information being presented</li>
              <li>Design concept arts and 3D-modeled assets in a timely manner that would be imported into games, making sure that all assets and designs would be accessible amongst team members</li>
              <li>Ensure artistic consistency across the game</li>
              <li>Utilize content management and design software to design, and maintain website content, graphics, and landing pages as well as monitoring adherence to compliance standards to market game</li>
            </ul>

These four models were made and animated in Blender.">

For the main menu, I wanted to make something to support this artistic direction in a simple yet captivating way, thus I created this helm that players can interact with.">

Again, the helm is used to show player's healthbar, and a score counter made to fit into the theme is displayed on the bottom left corner without distracting the player.">
