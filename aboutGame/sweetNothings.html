          <h3>Experience</h3>
          <p>This game is a product of two-semesters-worth of production. As the lead artist on my team, I was given the task of producing all the arts and assets for the game, ranging from concept art, character sprites, background design, and UI design.</p>
          <p>This role served as a reminder that as much as aesthetics can define a product, the ability to communicate to the audience and allow the audience to engage with the product seamlessly is just as important.</p>
          <p>Along the way, I was reminded of the importance of how much a strong bond between a group can provide a strong foundation for work,  as well.</p>
